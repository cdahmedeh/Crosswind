# LegacySimBridge

LegacySimBridge is a tool that allows older versions of Flight Simulator and X-Plane to work with some modern popular flight planning tools.

Simulator must be compatible with FSUIPC module or XPUIPC plugin. The tool has only been tested under Windows 11 with Flight Simulator 2004 and X-Plane 9. Comptability with your configuration or system cannot be guaranteed.
